The purposely inserted bug has to deal with enqueueing:

1.  When enqueue() is called, it adds to the front of the queue.
    
    Proof:
    This is visible in my fourth test as when I call peekFront() it is not equal to the first value.
    The way enqueue() is actually working is similar to a stack. 
    It adds new values to the front of the queue, when it should be adding to the back.


Note:
    Although this is not a bug, the documentation for dequeue() says it will return the value of the entry at the front of the          
    queue. This is false as 1, it should not do this, and 2, it is a void function which does not return anything.
