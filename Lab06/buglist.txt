The purposely inserted bug has to deal with enqueueing:

1.  When enqueue() is called, it adds to the front of the queue.
    
    Proof:
    This is visible in my fourth test as when I call peekFront() it is not equal to the first value.
    The way enqueue() is actually working is similar to a stack. 
    It adds new values to the front of the queue, when it should be adding to the back.
